# The "About Me" README of Anthony Keith

##  Synopsis
This is the Lab 02 for the Code Fellows bootcamp, I wanted the user to have an incredibly welcoming experience! In order to achieve that I added a variable to keep track of how many of the answers they got correct. At the end it totals their score and returns it back to them.

## How does he do that?!
In order to achieve this I needed a way to keep track of the number of questions that got correct!

Step 1. Initialize a variable to store the number of correct answers.

Step 2. When the user gets a correct answer, add one to the variable we created!

## Motivation
My motivation has always come from having over the top goals! Communication has never been something I've been good at; in order to improve I'm challenging myself to write clean documentation. 

As a user I've always enjoyed when website experiences are interactive. The goal was to make it feel like talking to a friend who remembered something small about you. Subtle but impactful.
